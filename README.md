overview: The Embedded Simulator is a C++ project designed to simulate the behavior of an embedded system. It includes basic components like GPIO handling, RTOS simulation, and control systems for traffic lights and temperature management. The project is intended to demonstrate fundamental concepts in embedded systems development and real-time operating systems (RTOS).

features:GPIO Handling: Simulates GPIO operations.
RTOS Simulation: Basic RTOS functionality including task creation and scheduling.
Traffic Light Control: Manages traffic light operations.
Temperature Control: Manages temperature control systems

requirements:C++17: The project uses C++17 standards.
CMake For building the project.
Visual Studio 2022 or vs code are recommended IDE for building and running the project.
Windows SDK required for building on Windows.
